========

Mutandis is a JavaScript mutation testing tool that leverages static and dynamic program analysis to guide the
mutation generation process towards parts of the code that are error-prone or likely to influence the programâ€™s
output.

The experimental data produced by Mutandis is available for download from the following link:
